Community Guidelines
====================

This document outlines what we value as a community.
In general, the Interfascia project strives to promote an
ethical, diverse, and just culture.

Contributors are asked to be mindful of these guidelines when participating
in community discussions.
Furthermore, contributors should be conscious that when they interact with
people outside the community, their actions reflect on the Interfascia project
in general.
We respect that everyone has a life outside of this community, but when acting
as a representative of Interfascia, these guidelines still apply.


# Specific Guidelines

These guidelines apply to all communication, online and off, including Github
discussons, chat channel discussions, mailing lists, and video chats.

In our behavior, we should:

- __Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.__ We work together to resolve conflict,
assume good intentions, and do our best to demonstrate empathy.
A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive.
We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as
with people outside our community.

- __Be considerate.__ Our work will be used by other people, and we depend on the
work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and
you should be aware of these consequences when making decisions.

- __Be respectful.__ Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for bad behaviour and poor manners.

- __Be careful in the words that we choose.__ Remember that sexist, racist, and
other exclusionary speech can be offensive and hurtful to those around us.
We strive to be kind to others.
Insulting or putting down other participants is destructive to the community.
Professional behavior doesn't mean we can't have fun, but it does mean we are
courteous and civilized.

- __Be open and transparent.__ We invite anyone to participate in our community.
We preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages,
unless discussing something sensitive.
This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too.
Not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to
a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by people
answering will be more easily detected and corrected.

- __Be inquisitive.__ Nobody knows everything! Asking questions
early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may
be directed to the appropriate forum.
Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our
shared goal of improving Apache project code.


# Diversity

__We welcome participation by everyone.__
We welcome and support people of every
gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
nationality, religion, age, ability, culture, political stance, skill level,
occupation, and background.

__We are inspired by creativity.__
Poets, painters, engineers, novelists, architects, photographers, and musicians
all have something meaningful to add to the community.

__Accessibility for people with disabilities is a priority, not an afterthought.__
Interfascia is a *human* interface library, and that means we need to support
as many humans as possible.
Whether someone deals with limited mobility, low vision, or colorblindness
shouldn't prevent them from using Interfascia or projects that employ it.
We strongly encourage all contributors to read the
[accessibility standards][as] and consider how to make Interfascia easier to
use for everyone.

__We know we won't get this right all the time, but this guide is a testament
to what we strive for.__
It is important to have patience, resilience, and composure.
We promise that if we get it wrong, we'll listen carefully and respectfully
to you when you point it out to us, and we'll do our best to make good on our
mistakes.

If you feel someone is not behaving in accordance to these guidelines or is
otherwise making the community an unhappy place to be, please email
[community@interfascia.berg.industries][community_email].


# Dispute Resolution

__When we disagree, try to understand why.__
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Interfascia
is no exception.
It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
Remember that we're different.
The strength of Interfascia comes from its varied community, people from a
wide range of backgrounds.
Different people have different perspectives on issues.
Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that
they're wrong.

__When things do go wrong, remember that blaming people is not constructive.__
Part of learning and growing as a developer is being able to make mistakes
without fear of punishment or retribution.
The goal of the community is to resolve issues in a way that makes us
collectively stronger.
By creating a safe space for people to make mistakes and recover from then,
we strive to create an environment where engineers are enthusiastic about
helping the community avoid making the same mistakes again.


# The Nitty-Gritty

Guidelines specific to specific tasks (like coding guidelines or usability
testing guidelines) will be added in separate documents as the need arises.

The community reserves the right to amend these guidelines in response to any
unforseen situations that arise.
If your behavior violates these guidelines, we will contact you by email.
If you don't take action to explain or correct your behavior, we may ask you
to stop participating in community discussions and communication.
Being asked to leave the community does not oblige the Interfascia team to
remove your prior contributions to the project.
The community leaders reserve the right to enforce these guidelines at our
sole discretion.
