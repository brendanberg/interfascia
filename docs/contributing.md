============

Contributions to Interfascia are welcome and appreciated! Contributions can
range from development to documentation and everything in between.

project structure and development workflow.

In addition to building a solid GUI library, it is also vital that we create
and maintain an inclusive, welcoming, and supportive community.
This 
In short, be courteous, take , and don't be a jerk.

# Getting Started

The Interfascia source is in the `interfascia` directory.
To build the library, use the `ant` build tool.
Either run `ant jar` on the command line, or import the `build.xml` file into
your IDE of choice.

# Testing

There is a huge opportunity for a kindly contributor to take the lead on this.

# What to Work On

A good place to see what needs work is in the [issue tracker][issues].
In the future, there will be a roadmap page in the wiki that discusses new
features and future directions for the library.

Questions, comments, and suggestions can be addressed to
