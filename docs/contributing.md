Contributing
============

Contributions to Interfascia are welcome and appreciated! Contributions can
range from development to documentation and everything in between.
Please read this project contribution guide to familiarize yourself with the
project structure and development workflow.

In addition to building a solid GUI library, it is also vital that we create
and maintain an inclusive, welcoming, and supportive community.
This 
In short, be courteous, take , and don't be a jerk.

# Getting Started

The Interfascia source is in the `interfascia` directory.
To build the library, use the `ant` build tool.
Either run `ant jar` on the command line, or import the `build.xml` file into
your IDE of choice.

# Testing

There is a huge opportunity for a kindly contributor to take the lead on this.

# What to Work On

A good place to see what needs work is in the [issue tracker][issues].
In the future, there will be a roadmap page in the wiki that discusses new
features and future directions for the library.

Questions, comments, and suggestions can be addressed to
